# learning-git
I used this project to teach myself git, github, and vscode.

The project was built in html, css, and javascript. After a while, I decided I wanted to pick up react, and realized that I wanted to support editing and saving of character sheets. 

Between those constraints, as well as some fundamental refactoring I wanted to do anyway, I realized It would be better to start a new repo and build from scratch. Consequently, I abandoned this repo.
